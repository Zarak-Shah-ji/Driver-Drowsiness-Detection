# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This project analyzes different techniques on how to detect driver drowsiness and compares them to find the best one. Our focus is to detect the face of the driver, primarily its eyes and head movement and assign a score based on how open or how closed the driverâ€™s eyes are and how titled is driver's head.
